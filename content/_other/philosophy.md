title: Philosophy that no one asked for
---

I hold the viewpoint that technology is an expressive medium with the ability to enrich our lived experiences. Following this, I believe that technology *should* *always* seek to acknowledge and improve the human condition and that this goal should underpin the work of all technologists. This perspective has lead me to approach my work a *Designer.*

Regardless, Iâ€™ve created plenty of websites and apps, co-operated a design studio, freelanced and travelled, worked full-time as both an engineer and designer, advised and invested in companies, and started (and ended) a venture of my own.
