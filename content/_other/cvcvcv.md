## Volley Studio

**Tag**: Designing a unique web experience for an NYC-based 3D rendering company

**About**: Volley Studio (Brooklyn, NY) is a small company specializing in the creation of high-quality 3D renderings for commercial architects and developers. I helped Volley redesign their website with the goal of displaying their work in an unconventional, original way. We were particularly interested in presenting the work as a series of overlapping images that could be moved around the screen freely.

**Design Process**: I worked closely with the internal team at Volley to design and prototype the site, using the team's initial sketches as a starting point and moving through multiple rounds of revision and refinement to arrive at the final design. The result is clean and pared-back, letting the images take a central focus and remaining faithful to the detail-oriented, diligent and creative culture behind Volley Studio.

**Tech:** Next.js + React, Sanity CMS, CSS3 Animation

## Neighby

**Tag**: Creating an MVP to launch a new Brooklyn-based startup.

**Meta:**

Year: 2018

Timeline: 6 months

Role: UI/UX Design, Development

Tech: AWS Lambda, React.js, Redux, mapbox, react-admin

Typography and Logo by 4GM

**About**: Neighby's goal is to make it easier to learn about New York's neighborhoods for people visiting or relocating. I was tasked with designing and building the first version of the web app to get the company up and running. The final product features both a matching algorithm for people looking for a certain type of neighborhood and a way for users to upload their own ratings for neighborhoods they're familiar with.

**Process:** When I first met Neighby's founder over coffee, the idea for the app was in his head and he was looking for someone to help bring it to life. The project started by putting pen to paper - drawing user flows and interface components to start to give form to the product. 

**Wireframing:** After identifying the core features on paper, we moved through an iterative series of higher fidelity digital mockups which ultimately let to the final product. The resulting web app is simple, friendly, robust and efficient, with the needs of an early startup in mind.

**Code:**

**Backend:**

**Closing Thoughts:** Wish we had more budget for interactivity. Not happy with the ratings-overview pane

## Aiva Health

**Tag:** Designing a user interface for a seed-stage healthcare startup in LA.

**About:** AIVA builds moderns solutions for forward-thinking hospitals. Their goal is to increase the overall effectiveness of medical care with smart, technology-driven systems that replace or augment current legacy software. I got to work with AIVA to design a web UI that hospital administrators could use to manage IoT devices in their hospitals.

**Design Process:** To start the process, I met extensively with the backend engineers to understand the ins and outs of the software. From there, I worked closely with the team to sketch interface concepts on paper that matched both the software model and addressed the needs of the product. Using their guidance, we iterated on the interface to develop a clean, trustworthy and simple interface that feels at home in a modern healthcare setting. 

**Tech:** GraphQL, React.js, Webpack
