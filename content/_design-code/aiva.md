## Aiva Health

**Tag:** Designing a user interface for a seed-stage healthcare startup in LA.

**About:** AIVA builds moderns solutions for forward-thinking hospitals. Their goal is to increase the overall effectiveness of medical care with smart, technology-driven systems that replace or augment current legacy software. I got to work with AIVA to design a web UI that hospital administrators could use to manage IoT devices in their hospitals.

**Design Process:** To start the process, I met extensively with the backend engineers to understand the ins and outs of the software. From there, I worked closely with the team to sketch interface concepts on paper that matched both the software model and addressed the needs of the product. Using their guidance, we iterated on the interface to develop a clean, trustworthy and simple interface that feels at home in a modern healthcare setting. 

**Tech:** GraphQL, React.js, Webpack
