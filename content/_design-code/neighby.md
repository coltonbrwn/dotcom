**About**: Neighby's goal is to make it easier to learn about New York's neighborhoods for people visiting or relocating. I was tasked with designing and building the first version of the web app to get the company up and running. The final product features both a matching algorithm for people looking for a certain type of neighborhood and a way for users to upload their own ratings for neighborhoods they're familiar with.

**Process:** When I first met Neighby's founder over coffee, the idea for the app was in his head and he was looking for someone to help bring it to life. The project started by putting pen to paper - drawing user flows and interface components to start to give form to the product. 

**Wireframing:** After identifying the core features on paper, we moved through an iterative series of higher fidelity digital mockups which ultimately let to the final product. The resulting web app is simple, friendly, robust and efficient, with the needs of an early startup in mind.

**Closing Thoughts:** Wish we had more budget for interactivity. Not happy with the ratings-overview pane
