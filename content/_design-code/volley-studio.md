## Volley Studio

**Tag**: Designing a unique web experience for an NYC-based 3D rendering company

**About**: Volley Studio (Brooklyn, NY) is a small company specializing in the creation of high-quality 3D renderings for commercial architects and developers. I helped Volley redesign their website with the goal of displaying their work in an unconventional, original way. We were particularly interested in presenting the work as a series of overlapping images that could be moved around the screen freely.

**Design Process**: I worked closely with the internal team at Volley to design and prototype the site, using the team's initial sketches as a starting point and moving through multiple rounds of revision and refinement to arrive at the final design. The result is clean and pared-back, letting the images take a central focus and remaining faithful to the detail-oriented, diligent and creative culture behind Volley Studio.

**Tech:** Next.js + React, Sanity CMS, CSS3 Animation
