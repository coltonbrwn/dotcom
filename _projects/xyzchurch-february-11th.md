### Concept

XYZ was a platform designed to facilitate the coordination and production of music. It utilized web3 technologies in order to enable community ownership, transparency, and incentive. It was announced on October 28th 2021, launched on February 11th, and wound-down on April 1, 2021.

XYZ raised an initial crowdfund via Mirror post which can be accessed here

- [https://mirror.xyz/c0lt.eth/crowdfunds/0x3D2333e0DDc21C05aceCE6432C7E602e57c0c653](https://mirror.xyz/c0lt.eth/crowdfunds/0x3D2333e0DDc21C05aceCE6432C7E602e57c0c653)

The treasury reached an alltime high of $20k, from 20 active supporters. The money was used to finance artwork and production of the first release - *Self Reflection EP.*

XYZ ultimately wound down due to a misalignment of vision and capability. I simply lacked the experience, skills and time to run a successful community while iterating on product. XYZ’s lifespan was short 

### Technologies

- DAOs
- Smart Contracts
- Ethereum
- NFTs
- Frontend Javascript

### Brand

The name of the organization comes from the common domain name .xyz. Given the experimental and preliminary state of the organization, the brand reflects the aesthetic of architectural blueprints. The meaning of XYZ was extended to include the coordinate plane.

### Learnings

In this project I learned a lot about the demands of building and running a community, learned how to write solidity contracts and worked hands-on with the blockchain. On a personal level I realized that the problem of making compelling art is more pressing, educational, and nourishing than distributing it.

Assumptions

- Art as a produced entity
    - does that imply art as commodity?
    - (as opposed to art as immaterial expression)
        - Although to be fair the impetus to make this DAO

⭐️ crypto is about the materiality / ownership / commodification of data.

Cryptography fundamentally ties a piece of data to an individual privileged entity.

Questions 

- What is the relationship between Markets, Music and Crypto?
- What are the differences between digital art markets and digital music markets?
